 Desription: Write a program that first asks for the number of students in a class section (with a maximum of 20 being
 allowed) and then prompts the user for each studentâ€™s exam score, starting with student #1. Each of these
 scores is to be stored in an array. Once all scores are entered, search the array to display the highest and lowest
 scores, and then process the array to calculate and display the class average.
